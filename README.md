# Gun-Violence
# Project Outline
This is a Deceptive project, where we create a deceptive visualization from the existing data. It is done in many different ways like data manipulation, truncating the axis and much more.
# Data
The data I am using is for the deaths that take place from guns, it contains gun death rate for each state of United States of America, number of gun deaths, population for each state and how are the laws for gun violence in each state. By the laws I mean there are three categories of laws Firm, Moderate and weak, I got the data for the laws in the forms of grades that are A, A-, B, B+, C, C-, D, F and then I categorized them as Firm, Moderate, and Weak. 
For the first visualization, the columns of the data I used are:
-	States
-	Laws
-	Death rate
