# Gun-Violence
# Project Outline
This is a Deceptive project, where we create a deceptive visualization from the existing data. It is done in many different ways like data manipulation, truncating the axis and much more.
# Data
The data I am using is for the deaths that take place from guns, it contains gun death rate for each state of United States of America, number of gun deaths, population for each state and how are the laws for gun violence in each state. By the laws I mean there are three categories of laws Firm, Moderate and weak, I got the data for the laws in the forms of grades that are A, A-, B, B+, C, C-, D, F and then I categorized them as Firm, Moderate, and Weak. 

For the first visualization, the columns of the data I used are:
-	States
-	Laws
-	Death rate

# Lax Rules Lead to Higher Mortality!

# Audience: People who want to know which state has the most and the least gun deaths in America.

# Claim: Lax Rules Lead to Higher Mortality! 
This says where there are the weak laws there we have the most gun deaths and where there are strict laws we have the least gun deaths.

I choosed this metrics as i stay in california so i started at looking first for california, and i found california has really strict laws for gun violence and then i got data for the death rate. I saw it has less deaths, and then i choosed a state which has very weak law like alaska and compared both the states and saw it has got a very high rate of gun violence so i decided to go with this metric and collected data for the laws for each state and death rates and created a metrics that support my claim. Metrics is a glue between the data and the claim.

# Deceptiveness 
This visualization is deceptive as it's the manipulation of data as it depicts that the states that have the strict laws have the less number of gun deaths, but this is not the truth as in this visualization its depicted the death rate which is death rate for 100,000 people. But the population actually varies from state to state. So to look at the population factor and look at the actual number of deaths i made another visualization. 

# Ineffectiveness of Strict Gun Laws!

# Audience: People who want to know which state has the most and the least gun deaths in America.

# Claim: Ineffectiveness of Strict Gun Laws!
This says that if a state has a strict gun law they still have the most gun violence.

For this visualization, the columns of the data I used are:
-	States
-	Laws
-	Number of Deaths 
- Population

I choosed this metrics as when i saw the population of california and calculated the actual number of deaths for that population came more and then i calculated it for alaska the number of deaths came less and then i realised the previous visualization was deceptive so i planned to plot this data on tableau and when i did it became a rebuttal of the first one. 

# Two Claims Out of a Single Dataset!

<img width="1065" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 2 29 14 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32226800/32971798-c12ce6fa-cba3-11e7-8ca0-9291acee63f7.png">

As in this the area chart depicts the actual number of deaths and line chart depicts the death rate, now when we combine both charts together we can clearly see the differnce and this is the reason why we can get two claims from the single dataset.We can clearly see the actual number of deaths are more than the death rate. But we do have few exceptions like florida and texas. 

# Project Takeaway: 
- Data deception is due to data manipulation and data calculation.
- Claim hold a very important part at the time of designing a visulaization. As a visualization can be deceptive or truthful.
