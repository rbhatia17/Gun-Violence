# Gun-Violence
# Project Outline
This is a Deceptive project, where we create a deceptive visualization from the existing data. It is done in many different ways like data manipulation, truncating the axis and much more.
# Data
The data I am using is for the deaths that take place from guns, it contains gun death rate for each state of United States of America, number of gun deaths, population for each state and how are the laws for gun violence in each state. By the laws I mean there are three categories of laws Firm, Moderate and weak, I got the data for the laws in the forms of grades that are A, A-, B, B+, C, C-, D, F and then I categorized them as Firm, Moderate, and Weak. 
For the first visualization, the columns of the data I used are:
-	States
-	Laws
-	Death rate

# Lax Rules Lead to Higher Mortality!

# Audience: People who want to know which state has the most and the least gun deaths in America.

# Claim: Lax Rules Lead to Higher Mortality! 
This says where there are the weak laws there we have the most gun deaths and where there are strict laws we have the least gun deaths.

I choosed this metrics as i stay in california so i started at looking first for california, and i found california has really strict laws for gun violence and then i got data for the death rate. So, i plotted this on tableau and i saw it has less deaths, and then i choosed a state which has very weak law like alaska and plotted that and saw it has got a very high rate of gun violence so i decided to go with this metric and collected data for the laws for each state and death rates and created a metrics to support my claim.
I created this visualisation to see where there are the most gun deaths, as according to this i got the states which have strict laws have less number of gun deaths, and this supports my claim

# Flaws and Deceptiveness 
This visualisation is deceptive as it depicts that the states that have the strict laws have the less number of gun deaths, but this is not the truth as in this visualisation its depicted the death rate which is death rate for 100,000 population. But the population actually varies
